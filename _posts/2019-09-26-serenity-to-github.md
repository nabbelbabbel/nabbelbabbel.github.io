Starting with the release of version 1.1.0 Serenity has now a release only mirror on GitHub.
The repository can be found at [https://github.com/qcserenity/serenity](https://github.com/qcserenity/serenity).

By now Version 1.2.0 has been released there aswell, and Version 1.3.0 is already in the making.  
I and all the developers invite anyone to browse the code and open issues as they find bugs or have questions.
