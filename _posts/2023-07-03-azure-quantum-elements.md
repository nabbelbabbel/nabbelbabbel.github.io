On the 28th of June 2023 Microsoft announced Azure Quantum Elements and started
[private previews](https://quantum.microsoft.com/en-us/our-story/quantum-elements-overview).
See the announcement [here (Video)](https://news.microsoft.com/azure-quantum-june-event/) and 
a written version of their mission statement
[in this blog post](https://news.microsoft.com/source/features/innovation/azure-quantum-elements-chemistry-materials-science/).
I am happy to share that SCINE is part of this new platform. 
[SCINE is the Software for Chemical Interaction Networks developed in the Reiher research group.](https://scine.ethz.ch/)
It is a framework of software packages to enable the automated investigation of chemical 
reaction processes by exploration of (chemical reaction networks)[https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-physchem-071119-040123].
All software packages are open-source and can also be downloaded from GitHub and PyPI.
The repositories can be found at [https://github.com/qcscine/](https://github.com/qcscine/).
SCINE one of my long-term research projects central to my work
in the Reiher research group at ETH Zurich, it is developed by many fantastic people and I 
am happy to see our work broadcasted to many more researchers in academia and industry around the world.
