The software for chemical interaction networks (SCINE) aims to offer developments 
for 21st-century computational quantum chemistry. 
A central idea underpinning the design of SCINE is the automated exploration of 
chemical reaction networks with interactive steering. Reaching this goal has required 
new developments in many traditional branches of quantum chemistry. 
SCINE is intended to provide a unifying framework for all these developments.

Serenity is a quantum chemistry program focused on, but not exclusively for subsystem methods.  
  
SCINE is wirtten in C++ (C++14) with a Python3 interface and the released parts of the source code are hosted on 
[GitHub (link)](https://github.com/qcscine)
